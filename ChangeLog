hammer3d (1.0.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted parameter of BOIDS
  * Changed Max number of Sardines to 150
    - if your device become slow or choppy, please adjust
      speed and number of sardines.
  * Separated "process of escape from enemy" from "process of BOIDS".
    Because I want sardines to escape more intelligibly.
  * Speed up when sardine escape from enemy.

hammer3d (1.0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Improved a part of the BOIDS algorithm
  Because there was concern at transaction speed,
  I made processing short in a BOIDS part.
  However, there was not the need by the improvement
  of the drawing part. thus I did a BOIDS part properly.
