hammer3d (1.0.2) stable; urgency=high

  * Fixed Bug.
    - I did not make the place that I should run again.
      Therefore it crashes.

hammer3d (1.0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Improved a part of the BOIDS algorithm
  Because there was concern at transaction speed,
  I made processing short in a BOIDS part.
  However, there was not the need by the improvement
  of the drawing part. thus I did a BOIDS part properly.
